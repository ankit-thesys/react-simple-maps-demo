# React Simple Maps Demo

This is a demonstration project for exploring the capabilities of [react-simple-maps](https://www.react-simple-maps.io/) library with Next.js.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## APIs Used

- **USGS Earthquake API**: Real-time earthquake data (no authentication required)
  - Endpoint: `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/`
- **OpenWeather Air Pollution API**: Real-time and historical air quality data (free tier available)
  - Endpoint: `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/air_pollution`
  - Get your free API key at: https://openweathermap.org/api

## Environment Setup

For the Air Quality Dashboard, you need to set up an OpenWeather API key:

1. Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
4. Add your API key to `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

**Note**: The free tier includes 1,000 API calls per day, which is sufficient for this dashboard.
